# Homelab Server Management Projects

Welcome to my Homelab Server Management repository!  
This repository showcases my hands-on experiments in server administration, cybersecurity, automation, and AI integration using my personal Dell R720 server environment.

## 🛠️ Projects and Topics

### 🔒 Encrypted Backup Automation
- Developed a Bash script to backup critical system directories and encrypt them using GPG AES-256 encryption.
- Implemented scheduled backups with cron jobs for automated daily secure backups.

### 🛡️ Linux Server Hardening
- Applied system security best practices, including SSH key-based authentication, firewall configuration (UFW), and fail2ban intrusion prevention setup.
- Performed vulnerability scanning using OpenVAS/Nessus Essentials and remediated findings.

### 📈 Monitoring and Security Auditing
- Used Wireshark for real-time traffic analysis and troubleshooting.
- Conducted Linux system security audits using Lynis and applied benchmarked hardening techniques.

### 🤖 AI and Local LLM Deployment
- Installed and configured local Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Ollama and OpenWebUI on Ubuntu VMs.
- Built experimental AI chat systems to interact with local datasets (beginner-level RAG integration).

## 📚 Technologies and Tools
- Ubuntu Server, Proxmox Virtualization
- Bash Scripting, Python Automation
- GPG Encryption, SSH, UFW, Fail2ban
- Wireshark, Nessus Essentials, OpenVAS
